# Washington STEM's Horizons Technical Assistance Templates
Today, only 40% of high school graduates in Washington enroll in higher education; however upwards of 80% of well-paying jobs in the state require some sort of postsecondary credential. This means many students, most often students of color and low-income students, will not have access to family-sustaining jobs and secure careers. 

Washington STEM manages the Horizons grants, a four year regional partnerships to boost student transitions from high school to 1-year certificate programs, two- and four-year degree programs and apprenticeships. The Horizons partnerships, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation includes K-12 schools, colleges, and community-based organizations in the Olympic and Kitsap peninsulas, the Southwest region, the Palouse, and South King County.

Washington STEM also provides technical assistance to regional partners as they build capacity around accessing and leveraging data to improve student outcomes. Other technical advisors in the partnership include Sankofa, Scholar Fund, and College Access: Research in Action (CARA). These experts in their field will work with education partners to, respectively, enhance measurement and evaluation, equity and student voice (surveys), and advising, all through a continuous improvement model aimed at sustainability.

### Code of Conduct: 
These templates are designed to help researchers and educators, improve equitable
postsecondary readiness by better understanding patterns between high school experiences and
postsecondary outcomes. This dashboard can help 
* Challenge Hunches
* Understand patterns across high school coursetaking, financial aid completion, and postsecondary enrollment, persistence, and completion

These resources should be used to analyze strengths and weaknesses of the school system, not individual students, families, or staff.
